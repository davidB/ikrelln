Test Reporting for the robots _because who has time to read all those tests results?_

i'Krelln is a test reporting and tracing system. It helps gather test execution data needed to troubleshoot failures. It manages both the collection and lookup of this data.

## Quick start

You can start i'Krelln by Docker:
 
 ```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 ikrelln/ikrelln
```

Once it started, browse to http://localhost:8080 to find your tests results!
